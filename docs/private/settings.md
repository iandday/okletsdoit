# Wedding Settings

This page explains the fields shown on the Wedding Settings screen. Use it as a guide when updating the settings so your guests see the right information during the RSVP flow.

Quick notes
- These settings control what guests see on the public RSVP pages.
- Changes take effect after you save the form.
- Keep text short and clear — guests respond faster to concise labels and instructions.

## Display Details
- **Wedding Date** — Date of the wedding. Shown on public pages and used in countdowns. Use YYYY‑MM‑DD.
- **Site Title / Headings** — Short strings used for page titles and breadcrumb headings.

## RSVP Settings
These values control the top-level RSVP experience.

- **Allow RSVP** — Toggle to show or hide the RSVP flow to guests.
- **RSVP Accept Button Text** — The label on the button guests press to accept (e.g. "Yes, I'll be there").
- **RSVP Decline Button Text** — The label on the button guests press to decline (e.g. "Sorry, can't make it").
- **RSVP Accept Success Message** — Short confirmation shown after a guest accepts.
- **RSVP Decline Success Message** — Short confirmation shown after a guest declines.

Practical tip: use friendly, action‑oriented text for buttons (e.g. "Count me in") and short confirmations (one sentence).

## RSVP Accept Page Settings
These fields appear during the multi‑step acceptance flow.

- **RSVP Attending Checkbox Label** — The text next to the main attending checkbox (e.g. "Will you attend the wedding?").
- **RSVP Overnight Checkbox Label** — The text for the overnight/accommodation checkbox (e.g. "Do you need accommodation?").
- **RSVP Accept Page Intro Paragraph** — Intro text shown at the start of the accept flow (use 1–3 short paragraphs).
- **RSVP Accommodation Intro Paragraph** — Text shown on the accommodation step (short instructions or options).

Writing tip: keep intro paragraphs scannable. Avoid long blocks of text.

## RSVP Questions
Questions are either text response, single select, or mulit-select
Example:
- **Question** — `Will you attend the rehearsal dinner?`
- **Description** — `Optional – starts at 6pm`
- **Required** — `No`
- **Order** — `10`
- **Published** — `Yes`

Design guidance: use boolean questions for quick yes/no choices (e.g. attendance, plus-one, shuttle needed).



Example:
- **Question** — `Dietary requirements`
- **Field Type** — `text`
- **Placeholder** — `e.g. vegetarian, no nuts`
- **Required** — `No`
- **Order** — `20`
- **Published** — `Yes`



## How to edit settings
1. Open the Wedding Settings edit screen in the admin or settings UI.
2. Update labels and intro text where needed.
3. Add, reorder (via Order value), publish/unpublish RSVP questions.
4. Save and preview the public RSVP page to confirm changes.

## Practical tips for better responses
- **Keep labels short and clear** — guests skim rather than read.
- **Minimize required fields** — only mark essential fields required to reduce friction.
- **Preview changes** — always preview the public RSVP flow after saving.
- **Use helpful placeholders and descriptions** — they guide guest responses and reduce errors.

## Accessibility & formatting
- Use plain language and avoid emojis in labels for screen reader clarity.
- Intro fields may support simple formatting; keep it semantic and short.
